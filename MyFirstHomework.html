    <h1> All About Me</h1>
    <h2> Hello and welcome to my website, where you'll learn all about me!</h2>
    <p>My name is Hannah, I'm 31 and I'm from London. I currently do Global Communications for skincare brand. In my spare time I like to hang out with friends/family, listen to my fave podcasts (Closest Confessions, 90s Babys Show, The Receipts and HC Pod) and go to concerts/live music shows.</p>
    <p>I enjoy reading and I'm particularly interested in books by Black authors. My current read is "Americanah" a fiction novel by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; check out the synopsis below:</p>

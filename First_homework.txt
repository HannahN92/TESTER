Question 1:
What does HTML stand for, and what is its primary purpose in web development?

It stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It tells web browsers how to structure and display the content of a web page.


Question 2:
Explain the difference between HTML elements and HTML attributes. Provide examples of
Each.
HTML elements are the building blocks for a webpage, for example “<p> This is a paragraph</p>” is an element that creates a paragraph. HTML attributes are special words that provide additional information about the elements. For example, <img src=”image.jpg” alt=”a picture”> is an element that displays an image, however, src and alt are attributes that specify the source and alternative text of the image. 

Question 3:
What is the purpose of the “DOCTYPE” declaration in an HTML document? What happens if you omit it?
It is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. If it is omitted, the browser may switch to another mode where it uses a different rendering engine that may not support HTML.

Question 4:
Describe the difference between inline elements and block-level elements in HTML. Give
examples of each.
Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width of the container, creating a block of content. Examples of these are: <div>, <p> or <h1>-<h6>, etc. Inline elements do not start on a new line and take up only the necessary width to fit their content, creating a line of content. They do not have top and bottom margins, but they can have left and right margins. Examples of these are <span>, <a> or <img> etc. 


Question 5:
Explain the significance of the following HTML tags and their usage:

<head> = a container for metadata
<div> = an element that defines a division in an HTML document
<A> = an element that defines a hyperlink - used to link from one page to another
<img> = an element that defines an image in an HTML document
<ul> = unordered list - a list of items that do not have a numerical order
<ol> = ordered list - a list of items that have a numerical order
<li> = list - used in an ordered or unordered list 

Question 6:
What are semantic HTML elements? Provide examples of semantic elements and explain
why they are important for web accessibility and SEO.

They are elements that clearly describe their meaning in a human and machine readable way. They convey the meaning both to the browser and the developer. For example:
 <header> = is used to indicate the header section of a webpage
<nav> = is used to indicate the navigation menu
<article> = is used to indicate a self-contained piece of content

These elements are important for web accessibility and SEO because they help users and search engines understand the structure and meaning of the web page.


Question 7:
What is the purpose of the HTML form element (<form>) and its associated form controls?

To collect and submit information from the user to a web server. A form control is a special element that allows the user to enter or select data such as text fields, check boxes or buttons.


Question 8:
How can you add comments in HTML? Why are comments useful in web development?

You can add comments by adding in the following text <!-- write your comments here –!> into the HTML document. The comments are not processed by the web browser; they help you and other developers to understand, organise and debug your HTML code.



Question 9:
What is the HTML5 standard, and what are some of the new features introduced in HTML5?
It is the fifth and final major version of the HTML standard, which is used for structuring and presenting content on the web. Some of the new features introduced are:
New semantic elements - provide more meaningful structure to web pages
Vector graphics - enables drawing scalable and interactive graphics
Forms 2.0 - provides new attributes and input types for the <input> element

Question 10:
Explain the concept “responsive web design” and how HTML contributes to creating
responsive websites.
It is a web design approach that aims to make web pages render well on all screen sizes and resolutions while ensuring good usability. 
HTML contributes to creating responsive websites by providing the content and structure of the web pages, which can be automatically resized, hidden, shrunk, enlarged, or moved by using CSS.
